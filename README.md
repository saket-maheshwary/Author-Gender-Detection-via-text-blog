# Author-Gender-Detection-via-text-blog

The aim of the project is given a blog( short length text),we need to analyze the text differentiating whether it is written
by a male or a female by using machine learning techniques.Text is still the most prevalent Internet media type. Applications
such as Twitter, Craigslist, Facebook, etc. Other web applications such as e-mail, blog, chat rooms, etc. are also mostly text
based.

Identifying the correct set of features that indicate gender is an open research problem.
Three machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, Bayesian logistic regression and AdaBoost decision tree) are then 
designed for gender identification based on the proposed features.
